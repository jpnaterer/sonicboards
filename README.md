# SonicBoards

SonicBoards is a web application that makes it easier to navigate the overwhelming number of music sources on the web. The primary sources are Bandcamp, Pitchfork, and AllMusic.

## How does it work?

I have set web-crawlers to search each website every week. These web-crawlers are located in the scripts directory, along with a file to update the corresponding Mongo database. The app directory contains the Angular front-end code for the website, while the server directory contains the Node.js backend code.

## How do I make a suggestion?

## Is there a static version of this site?

I have a static backup of the code located [here](https://github.com/thetreblechef/thetreblechef.github.io) in case I ever want to stop hosting the webpage.
